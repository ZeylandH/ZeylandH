## Media Creation

I am a part of a local-scale family business, [You Buy We Build](youbuy-webuild.com). We assemble most merchandise - from boxed furniture to large gazebos.

I am currently initiating a social media presence with the company and will be periodically uploading videos of assembly to reach viewers this summer.

I have also collaborated to create the company logo, design the newest business card, and have frequently contributed to on-site operations.

# Projects

## In Progress
I am currently working on a Resin Lens that uses a unique fluid principle to create dimensionally accurate lenses with exceptionally cheap and accessible parts.
